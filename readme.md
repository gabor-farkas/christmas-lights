# Christmas lights
A home project that drives a line of RGB leds. It works using:
* A Raspberry PI 1
* Raspbian installed with Java 7 and Tomcat
* A native PWM adapter, https://github.com/gabor-farkas/pipwm4j
* A dummy board for the driver transistors

It's controllable via a http web interface over WiFi
